This project depends on the following resources:

- Monocraft / Part of the font is taken here: https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft/
- Glyph Tools / Thanks to this tool, it was possible to add some symbols that did not exist in Bedrock: https://github.com/NhanAZ/glyph

Special thanks to:

- coztellation: To her for making much of this project possible, fixing some existing problems and giving me permission to use some of her work.
